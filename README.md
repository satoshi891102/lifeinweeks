# Life in Weeks

Your entire life, visualized as ~4,000 tiny boxes. Each one is a week.

**[→ See yours](https://lifeinweeks-azure.vercel.app)**

## What it does

Enter your birthday. See a grid of 80 years × 52 weeks = 4,160 boxes:
- **Colored boxes** = weeks you've already lived
- **Gray boxes** = weeks remaining  
- **Red dot** = you are here

Each life phase has its own color: Childhood → School → Teenager → Young Adult → Building → Prime → Wisdom → Legacy.

## Stats

- Weeks lived & remaining
- Summers left
- Current life phase
- Progress percentage

## Privacy

Your birthday never leaves your browser. Zero tracking. Zero storage. Zero cookies.
